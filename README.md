# YouTube Blocker
A Chrome extension that blocks recommended videos in the sidebar and endscreen from showing up, to avoid distractions. 

## How to install
Download the code as zip and unzip it. Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on developer mode. Click "Load unpacked" and choose the folder you unzipped. Pin the extension for easy access. 

## Known bugs
Every time the extension window is opened, it resets both toggles to the off position, so sometimes you need to click twice for the toggle to work.
